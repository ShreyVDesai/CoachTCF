### Tagline

Master French daily with AI-powered TCF exam coaching in just 5-6 minutes.

### Inspiration

Learning a new language is hard. The TCF (Test de Connaissance du Français) is even harder. Traditional study methods are time-consuming, lack personalization, and don't provide consistent feedback. We wanted to create a tool that:

1. Makes daily practice achievable (5-6 minutes)
2. Provides personalized AI feedback
3. Tracks progress over time
4. Focuses on ONE improvement daily to avoid overwhelm

### What it does

CoachTCF provides daily French practice sessions with three tasks:

1. **Listening Comprehension** - AI-generated French audio with multiple-choice questions
2. **Speaking Practice** - 2-minute audio recording with pronunciation feedback
3. **Writing Exercise** - 50-80 word prompt with grammar/vocabulary analysis

After each session, GPT-4o evaluates all responses and provides:
- CEFR level assessment (A1 → C1)
- Detailed scores (listening, vocabulary, grammar)
- Pronunciation feedback
- ONE targeted correction for tomorrow

The dashboard visualizes progress over time with interactive charts, streak tracking, and historical data.

### How we built it

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Recharts
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: Raindrop SmartSQL (PostgreSQL)
- **Storage**: Raindrop SmartBuckets (audio files)
- **AI**: Raindrop SmartInference (GPT-4o multimodal)
- **Hosting**: Vultr Cloud Compute (frontend), Raindrop Platform (backend)

**Key Integrations:**
1. **Raindrop SmartSQL** stores user accounts, sessions, and results
2. **Raindrop SmartBuckets** securely stores audio recordings
3. **Raindrop SmartInference** powers content generation and evaluation
4. **Vultr** hosts the production frontend with high availability

**Audio Recording:** Browser-based MediaRecorder API captures speech, converts to base64, and uploads to SmartBuckets.

**AI Evaluation:** GPT-4o receives all three task responses and returns structured JSON with scores, CEFR level, and personalized feedback.

### Challenges we ran into

1. **Audio Recording Complexity** - Implementing browser-based recording with proper format conversion and size limitations required careful handling of MediaRecorder API and base64 encoding.

2. **AI Response Consistency** - Getting GPT-4o to consistently return structured JSON required prompt engineering and fallback parsing logic.

3. **Real-time Validation** - Implementing live word count, recording timers, and progress tracking required careful state management in React.

4. **Database Schema Design** - Balancing normalization with query performance for progress tracking required iterative refinement.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

- ✅ **Complete End-to-End Flow**: From registration to AI evaluation to progress tracking
- 🎤 **Seamless Audio Recording**: Browser-based recording that "just works"
- 🤖 **Smart AI Evaluation**: Multimodal GPT-4o analysis of text and audio
- 📊 **Beautiful Progress Tracking**: Interactive charts showing improvement over time
- 🚀 **Production-Ready**: Deployed on Raindrop + Vultr with SSL and monitoring
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

### What we learned

1. **Raindrop Platform Power** - SmartSQL, SmartBuckets, and SmartInference integrate seamlessly, providing a complete backend infrastructure without managing servers.

2. **AI Prompt Engineering** - Crafting effective prompts for consistent, structured responses is an art. We learned to be specific, provide examples, and implement fallbacks.

3. **User Experience Matters** - Small details like live word counts, recording timers, and progress bars significantly improve the experience.

4. **Scope Management** - Starting with core features and adding polish iteratively leads to better results than trying to build everything at once.

### What's next for CoachTCF

**Short-term (Post-Hackathon):**
- Add speech-to-text transcription (Whisper API)
- Implement spaced repetition for vocabulary
- Add achievement badges and gamification
- Support more CEFR levels (C2)

**Long-term:**
- **Multi-exam Support**: Expand to IELTS, TOEFL, DELE (Spanish), Goethe (German)
- **Mobile App**: Native iOS/Android apps
- **Social Features**: Study groups, leaderboards, challenges
- **Teacher Dashboard**: Track student progress
- **Premium Tier**: Unlimited sessions, advanced analytics, 1-on-1 coaching

**Expansion Possibilities:**
